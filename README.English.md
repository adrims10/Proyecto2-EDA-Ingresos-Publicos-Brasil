Welcome!

# *It's a pleasure to have you here*

# üìù What it is about:
Welcome to the vacation planning project! This project aims to help organize a vacation for two people, using web scraping techniques and APIs to gather information about flights, hotels, and activities.

Description.
The government of Brazil, through its various agencies, manages the collection of public revenues to fund services and projects that benefit society. Each year, a detailed plan is made to predict how much is expected to be collected, but often the actual collection differs from the forecast due to various factors such as tax evasion, economic fluctuations, administrative inefficiencies, among others.

You have been hired by the Ministry of Finance to analyze the historical data on revenue execution from 2013 to 2021. The mission is to identify patterns, detect problematic areas where collection has consistently been lower than expected, and propose recommendations based on the data to help improve the accuracy of forecasts and the efficiency of collection.

The specific problems you have been asked to solve are:

Deviations between forecasted and collected: Determine in which economic categories or types of revenue the differences are most pronounced.

Temporal evolution of collection: Identify how forecasts and collections have changed year by year, and if there are temporal patterns, such as specific months where there are major discrepancies.

Performance by agency and managing unit: Evaluate which agencies or managing units are more efficient in terms of meeting collection goals and which consistently show low execution.

**What have we offered?**
Data cleaning: Solve common problems such as missing values, inconsistent formats, and duplicates.

Data merging: Combine all files into a single dataframe for global analysis. If necessary, create an extra column to avoid losing information.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examine the relationship between different key variables and explore relevant categories to identify significant patterns or discrepancies.

Visualization: Generate graphs to identify relevant trends and patterns in the analyzed data.

Results, Conclusions

We can see the most important conclusions in the Presentation-Conclusions document.

**Next Steps**

Further analysis of each of the institutions.

Taking an extra step in data cleaning and processing.

Continue collecting data to analyze where the trend is heading.
